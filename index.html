        <p>Since the beginning of the pandemic, the general portrayal of the Asian American population has been one of the victim; viral videos showing physical abuse towards Asian elders, hate crimes against Asian communities and vitriolic, derogatory rhetoric perpetuated by public figures.</p>
        <p>It’s not inaccurate to state that there has been an increase in Asian Americans and Asian immigrants since the COVID-19 pandemic started. However, the narrative constructed by the combination of social media and news organizations have created a warped image of the Asian community that doesn’t entirely reflect the truth.</p>

        <p>A key part of why the Stop AAPI Hate movement took off were the various hate incidents targeting Asians, particularly against women and the elderly, that circulated around social media. The problem with this phenomena however, is that it shaped the narrative that minorities, specifically black people, were responsible for the majority of hate crimes against Asians.</p>
        <p>“That was the story I had in my head,” said Dr. Janelle Wong, director of Asian American Studies at the University of Maryland.</p>

        <div class="pull-quote">
          <p>“I began to look into the data, and the story was not exactly that story. Some of it resonates, but a lot of it was not what we were seeing in the media.”</p>
        </div>

        <p>Wong later published her findings to a Google Document, but would receive pushback due to her data challenging the narrative news outlets and social media were trying to spread.</p>
        <p>“I started getting a lot of hate mail myself from mostly white people and Asian Americans, who really didn’t like this narrative being challenged,” said Wong.</p>

        <p>According to surveys conducted by AAPI Data, the general consensus from those asked was that hate crimes against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders definitely increased during and after the pandemic. </p>
        <p>However, what wasn’t covered by the media was the increase in hate crimes against Black people, which also increased during this period. Due to the narrative of victimizing and highlighting the plights of Asian communities, the struggles of other minority groups were disproportionately covered.</p>
        <p>This creates the larger issue of perpetuating racial tensions between Asian Americans and Black Americans, which have historically been strained due to respective cultural stigmatizations and events like the 1992 Los Angeles riots, which saw Korean American communities clash with Black communities.</p>
        <p>While it’s necessary to cover and represent the struggles of Asian American voices in America, a country that has historically marginalized Asian voices, stereotyped Asian culture and fetishized Asian people, it’s important to remember that the fight against inequality is one that cannot be tackled alone. Allowing Asian communities to be isolated from others is what helped create the model minority myths, and created these strained relations with other minority groups.</p>
